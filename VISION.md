# OpenMemoryAgent: Research Vision

*What does user-sovereign AI memory actually look like when you try to build it?*

This document is the research record for OpenMemoryAgent. It is not a setup guide (see README.md) and not a feature list. It captures the design questions driving the project, what was actually learned building it, what the implementation honestly proves, and where the hard problems remain.

For the running implementation log — what was discovered building specific features, security findings, and what remains unresolved — see [DEVLOG.md](./DEVLOG.md). VISION.md is the stable research position; DEVLOG.md is the honest record of how it got there.

## The Core Question

Most AI products that remember you store that memory in the operator's infrastructure. Your conversation history, personality profile, preferences, and extracted facts live in Redis, Pinecone, or a managed PostgreSQL instance belonging to the company running the app. When you stop using the product, the memory stays with them. When they get acquired, your memory gets acquired. When they change their privacy policy, your memory is subject to those new terms.

The question this project is working through is simple to state but hard to implement well:

**What does it look like when the memory layer belongs to the user instead of the host application?**

That question is worth answering concretely, with a working chat interface, a real AI, and an actual storage layer that enforces identity at the protocol level.

---

## Why This Is Harder Than It Sounds

The obvious first move is "just let the user own the database." That doesn't work cleanly because of several interconnected problems.

1. **The AI needs to read the memory to generate responses.** If memory is fully private, the AI can't help you. Useful memory requires a read path the agent can use.

2. **Writes must be authenticated.** If anyone can write to your memory under your identity, the privacy claim is hollow. The write path needs cryptographic identity enforcement, not just application-level trust.

3. **The app server sits in the middle.** The server generates the LLM response, extracts the memory summary, and orchestrates everything. In a naive implementation the server can write whatever it wants under any identity. Removing the server from the write path requires the client (browser) to hold and use the signing key.

4. **Sensitivity is contextual.** Not all memory is equal. Your name is public. Your relationship status is personal. Your salary is sensitive. A binary public/private split loses nuance; treating everything as private makes the AI useless.

5. **The user has to be involved.** If the system silently classifies and stores everything, the user has approved nothing — they've just trusted the server with a different label on it. Real agency requires the user to see and decide on at least the sensitive cases.

These constraints define the design space this project is working in.

## What Was Built

OpenMemoryAgent is a working prototype of one concrete answer to the above questions. The stack is intentionally conventional (Laravel, Vue, Tailwind) so the novel parts are clearly isolated.

### What's different

**Browser-generated identity.** An Ed25519 key pair is generated in the user's browser on first load and persisted in `localStorage`. The server never sees the private key. The ICP principal derived from this key becomes the user's identity in the memory layer, not a server-assigned user ID.

**Browser-signed canister writes (live mode).** When the server extracts a memory summary, it returns it to the browser instead of writing it directly. The browser signs the write using the Ed25519 identity and sends it to the ICP canister. The canister uses `msg.caller` as the record owner, which is the browser's signed principal. The server cannot forge writes under the user's principal.

**Three-tier memory classification.** Each extracted memory is classified as Public, Private, or Sensitive by an LLM call. This classification determines what the agent can recall (only Public reaches the LLM), what the user must approve before signing (both Private and Sensitive), and what is accessible outside the app (only Public is served at the HTTP endpoint).

**Canister-level read enforcement.** The Motoko canister enforces access by `msg.caller`. The server adapter, the HTTP gateway, and the MCP server are all anonymous callers, so they receive only public records. Private and Sensitive records are returned only to a caller whose principal matches the record's owner. This is cryptographic enforcement, not application-level trust.

**Public HTTP endpoint.** Any public memory record is readable at `https://<canister-id>.ic0.app/memory/<principal>` with no authentication, no API key, and no dependency on the Laravel server. The record is accessible from a terminal, another application, or any MCP-compatible AI agent.

**MCP server.** A Model Context Protocol server wraps the public HTTP endpoint. Any MCP-compatible agent (Claude Desktop, other LLMs) can read a user's public memories by principal without touching the host application.

### What's standard

The chat interface, LLM integration, session management, and transcript storage are all unremarkable. The memory sensitivity classification is an LLM call with a structured prompt. The mock mode uses Laravel's file cache. None of this is unusual; it exists to make the novel parts demonstrable.

---

## What This Actually Proves

**The canister enforces identity at the protocol level.** In live ICP mode, `msg.caller` on `store_memory` is cryptographically the browser's Ed25519 principal. The server cannot write under a user's principal. This is a real property, not application-level trust, and it is verifiable by reading the Motoko source on-chain.

**Anonymous reads are limited to public records.** The LLM, the server adapter, and the MCP server all call the canister anonymously. The canister's `get_memories` returns private and sensitive records only to an authenticated caller whose principal matches the owner. The LLM cannot recall private or sensitive memories because the canister will not return them to an anonymous caller, not because of application logic.

**Memory outlives the application session.** The browser key survives chat resets. A user who clears their chat history still has the same principal and the same canister records. The memory is not session-scoped.

**Memory lives outside the app's database.** Records are stored in the canister, not in PostgreSQL. The HTTP endpoint works independently of the Laravel server. A user can read their public memories from any context using only their principal: another application, a terminal, or a different AI assistant.

**The MCP connection is real.** The MCP server reads from the canister's public endpoint. Any MCP-compatible agent can be given a principal and retrieve that user's public memories, with no integration work beyond adding the MCP server to their configuration.

---

## What This Does Not Prove

**User-controlled memory content.** The server still decides what text gets extracted and stored. The browser signs the write, but the user sees only the finished summary, not the extraction logic or any alternative phrasings that were considered. Approving a memory is consent to store that specific string, not consent to the summarization decision.

**Strong key custody.** `localStorage` is accessible to any same-origin JavaScript. An operator-controlled frontend could read the private key. A script injection attack could exfiltrate it. True user key custody requires a hardware key, WebAuthn, or Internet Identity. The current implementation is meaningfully better than a server-generated ID (the server never has the key) but meaningfully weaker than a hardware-backed identity.

**User-chosen classification.** The LLM classifies each memory. The user cannot say "mark this private." Classification accuracy depends on model quality and prompt design. There is no correction mechanism; a misclassified memory stays misclassified until it is deleted.

**Multi-device portability.** The Ed25519 key lives in one browser's `localStorage`. Clearing it generates a new identity. Cross-device access requires manual key export and import. Internet Identity would solve this, and it requires only swapping the identity source.

**Decentralized application layer.** The application itself (Laravel, Vue) runs on conventional infrastructure. Only the memory storage layer is decentralized. "Decentralized AI memory" is accurate; "decentralized AI" is not.

## The Honest Security Analysis

### What's real

- The server cannot write under the user's principal in live mode
- The canister enforces read access by `msg.caller`, which is cryptographic rather than application logic
- Private and Sensitive memories never reach the LLM recall path, enforced at both the canister and application layers
- Sensitive and Private memories require explicit user approval before any write happens, in both live mode and mock mode
- LLM classification failures discard the memory rather than defaulting to Public (fail-closed behavior)
- The adapter's live write path hard-rejects rather than silently dropping `memory_type`

### What's not real yet

- The user previously had no first-party path to read their own private or sensitive memories back within the app. This has been partially addressed with an authenticated owner-read panel in the chat UI, but the read flow deserves more attention.
- Classification is LLM-generated, non-deterministic, and uncorrectable by the user
- localStorage key custody is weaker than hardware-backed identity
- Mock mode is not a security simulation; it is a functional approximation for development

### The trust boundary

The honest version of the trust claim is this:

> In live ICP mode, the memory storage layer enforces its own access control independently of the host application. Private and Sensitive records are inaccessible to unauthenticated callers at the protocol level. The host application cannot forge writes under a user's identity. The user must approve both Private and Sensitive writes before they are signed.
>
> The host application still controls what text gets presented for signing. The user cannot fully verify that the LLM extraction is faithful to the conversation. The key is as secure as the browser environment it lives in.

## The Design Decisions That Defined This Project

### Decision 1: Keep the app conventional

The memory layer is the experiment; Laravel and Vue are not. This decision means the novel parts stand out clearly, and the project is approachable by anyone who has built a web app before.

### Decision 2: Browser-signed writes, not server-signed

If the server signed writes, it could write anything under any identity. Making the browser sign writes means the server must return the summary to the browser, which means the user sees it before it is committed. This is a real improvement in user agency, even if the summary itself was server-generated.

### Decision 3: Three tiers instead of two

Binary public/private is too coarse. "My name" and "my medical history" should not carry the same classification. Three tiers with user approval at the Private/Sensitive boundary give the user meaningful control in the cases that matter most, without requiring approval for every memory.

### Decision 4: Fail-closed on LLM classification errors

When the LLM returns something that cannot be parsed, the memory is discarded rather than defaulting to Public. Losing a memory fact is recoverable in the next conversation. Accidentally publishing a Sensitive memory as Public is not.

### Decision 5: LLM recall is explicitly public-only

The `getPublicMemories()` method exists as explicit application-layer policy, separate from the canister's enforcement. Even if the adapter were given an authenticated identity, the application layer would still filter to Public. This is defense in depth rather than relying on a single implicit property.

### Decision 6: Private memories require user review before storing

Initially, Private memories were auto-signed, with only Sensitive requiring approval. On reflection, relationships, health preferences, location, and habits are all Private by classification. Auto-signing these without the user seeing them is not meaningfully different from the server storing them. The approval boundary was moved to `!== public`.

---

## What Was Learned

**The hardest part is not the canister; it's the trust boundary in the middle.** The canister enforcement is clean and provably correct. The hard part is the server that sits between the user and the canister, generating summaries and deciding what to surface for approval. That server is still a trusted intermediary even in live mode. Reducing that trust requires either moving classification into the browser or making the classification verifiable.

**Mock mode creates a misleading development environment.** The default local development experience is mock mode, where there is no canister, no identity enforcement, and no meaningful privacy guarantee. Developers building against mock mode develop a different intuition about the system than users running in live mode. This gap is dangerous for a project where the security properties are the point.

**The write-only problem is real and visible.** A user who approves a private memory and then cannot see it again within the application has experienced a broken product, not a privacy feature. The first-party owner-read path is not optional; it is how the user verifies that the privacy guarantee is real.

**LLM classification is probabilistic infrastructure.** Treating LLM output as reliable classification for security-relevant decisions is dangerous without validation. The system currently assumes the LLM output is correct. In practice, classification accuracy will vary by model, by content type, and by language. Any production version of this needs human review or deterministic validation for the classification step.

**The demo story and the implementation must match exactly.** A claim that cannot be demonstrated live is worse than no claim. "Private memories are access-controlled" cannot be demonstrated if there is no first-party way to show the owner reading a private memory. The story must be constrained to what can actually be shown.

## The Research Questions This Opens

This project is one concrete implementation. The questions it surfaces are more interesting than the implementation itself.

1. **Can users meaningfully consent to memory storage if the server controls the summary?** The current model gives users veto power (reject the write) but not authorship (choose the summary). Is that sufficient?

2. **What is the minimum viable key custody story for AI memory?** Hardware keys are too heavy for most users. Internet Identity is more practical; what is the real cost of making that upgrade?

3. **Should the LLM read private memories at all?** Currently, private memories are inaccessible to the LLM by design. But a user might want their AI to remember private context. How do you build an opt-in path for agent access while maintaining the owner-only guarantee for other callers?

4. **What happens when memory migrates between AI providers?** If memory is in a canister and any agent can read public records via MCP, what does it mean to switch from one AI assistant to another? Can your memory follow you?

5. **What is the right granularity for user approval?** Per-memory approval (current model) is high-friction for frequent users. Bulk policy ("always store relationships as private") would be lower friction. How do you give users real control without requiring them to approve every extracted fact?

6. **Can the summarization step itself be user-verifiable?** Right now the user sees the summary but not the extraction process. Could a commitment scheme or verifiable computation make the relationship between conversation and stored summary auditable?

## The Strongest Truthful Pitch

> "We're working on what AI memory looks like when the storage layer enforces its own access control, independent of the host application. In live mode, the canister verifies the caller's cryptographic identity before returning private records. The LLM, the server, and external agents can only see what you've marked as public. Writes are signed by your browser key, not the server. The memory lives on open infrastructure and is readable by any tool that knows your principal.
>
> This is an experiment, not a product. The key is in localStorage. The classification is LLM-generated. The server still writes the summary. We know where the trust boundary actually is, and we can tell you exactly. What we've built is a specific, working instantiation of a question: what would it take for AI memory to belong to the user?"

## The Correct Division of Labour Between ICP and PostgreSQL

Research into ICP's actual architecture (Entry 006 in DEVLOG) produced a more precise picture of what each layer should own and why.

ICP is a CP system under the CAP theorem. Update calls go through consensus, which makes writes strongly consistent but introduces latency. Query calls are answered by a single replica with no consensus, returning in milliseconds. Chain key cryptography (Threshold ECDSA) is ICP's genuine differentiator: the canister holds a distributed private key where no single node has custody, enabling cryptographic identity enforcement that no application layer can replicate.

PostgreSQL is an AP-leaning system. Reads and writes are fast. Graph traversal, index queries, degree calculations, and weight updates all run within a chat turn. Physarum decay (daily bulk update) and Hebbian reinforcement (per-turn edge increment) require the speed of PostgreSQL and would be prohibitively expensive as ICP update calls.

The correct split is therefore:

**ICP owns:** raw memory records with msg.caller enforcement, a graph ownership registry (fingerprints of graph states the user has signed), cross-agent access grants, and the user's principal identity. These properties require consensus-grade consistency. They change infrequently. They must be tamper-proof.

**PostgreSQL owns:** the working memory graph (nodes, edges, weights), all Physarum dynamics, graph traversal for LLM context assembly, and Hebbian reinforcement on every chat turn. These operations must complete within a single request cycle. Slightly stale weights are acceptable; consensus latency is not.

**The bridge:** each PostgreSQL graph node stores the ICP record ID of its source memory as metadata, so ownership and relevance are both accessible from a single node record. When graph-guided retrieval selects nodes for LLM context, the ICP record proves ownership and the PostgreSQL weight proves current relevance.

The graph layer currently has no ownership enforcement, which reproduces at the graph level the same trust boundary problem ICP was introduced to solve at the record level. A graph ownership registry on ICP (signing graph fingerprints) is the correct fix, not moving the full graph to ICP.

## Next Steps if This Were Productionized

These are not near-term goals; they are the research trajectory the design points toward.

- Internet Identity or WebAuthn for key custody: Kinic has already demonstrated WebAuthn as the signing device on ICP, meaning the user's biometric or hardware token replaces Ed25519 KeyIdentity in localStorage. Swapping the identity source requires no other architectural change.
- Graph ownership registry on ICP: a lightweight canister that maps each principal to a signed fingerprint of their acknowledged graph state, so the graph layer gains the same tamper-proof ownership property that the record layer already has.
- User-correctable classification: let users re-classify or delete memories they disagree with, and propagate the correction through the graph (update node sensitivity, remove or reclassify edges).
- Opt-in private recall: a user-gated path for the LLM to access private memories for a session, with the canister returning private records only after the user's signed approval for that session.
- Memory portability: export principal and records, import into another application that uses the same canister interface. The graph is reconstructible from the ICP records by re-running graph extraction.
- zkTAM (Trustless Agentic Memory): Kinic's framework applies zero-knowledge proofs to prove that an agent used specific verified memories when generating a response. The active_node_ids field now returned by /chat/send is the precondition for this: it identifies exactly which memories were loaded into context for each turn. A zkML proof over that set closes the open research question about verifiable summarization.
- Graph-guided retrieval replacing flat getPublicMemories(): retrieve the Hebbian neighbourhood of the most recently active nodes rather than the full public set, so Physarum edge weights carry a genuine relevance signal instead of reflecting uniform co-occurrence across all public memories.

## The Larger Direction: AI Memory as a Living 3D Interface

The graph memory layer built in this project points toward a larger interface paradigm that is worth naming explicitly.

The current flat graph explorer (D3, 2D canvas) is the right foundation but not the destination. The destination is a Three.js 3D globe — the AI's brain as a navigable spatial object — where:

- Memory nodes live on and inside a sphere, positioned by semantic proximity not folder hierarchy
- Node geometry and animation encode type, sensitivity, recency, and connection strength
- The globe is *live*: when the AI reads memory to build a response, those nodes light up in sequence, making the agent's context load visible in real time
- When a new memory is written, the node materializes and its edges wire in as you watch

The cross-agent extension is where this becomes a fundamentally new kind of tool. Multiple agents working across projects are visible simultaneously as distinct activity regions on the globe. Shared memory nodes — facts referenced by more than one agent — glow between the regions. You can watch one agent's reasoning touch a node that another agent's reasoning has touched. The multi-agent memory topology becomes inspectable rather than invisible.

The file explorer connection is the deepest claim. The linear folder hierarchy is a 1970s interface applied to a 2025 problem. A folder tree is sequential, flat at each level, navigationally one-directional, and structurally oblivious to the semantic relationships between files. A 3D memory graph replaces folder hierarchy with spatial position, simultaneous visibility across projects, associative traversal by following edges, and relationship as a first-class UI primitive.

The memory graph already built is the data layer for this. The 3D visualization is the experience layer. They are the same system at different levels of rendering.

See DEVLOG Entry 002 for the full technical breakdown of what building this requires.
