/**
 * Prune dormant memory nodes that the Physarum model has forgotten.
 *
 * A node is pruned when both conditions hold:
 *   1. All of its edges have decayed to floor weight (<= 0.06).
 *   2. The node has not been accessed in the last 90 days.
 *
 * Nodes with no edges at all that are also older than 90 days are pruned
 * because they were never connected into the graph and carry no relational value.
 *
 * Pruning removes edges first, then the node. This is a hard delete — the data
 * is gone. Run this after the daily decay pass so the floor-weight condition
 * reflects the latest decay state.
 *
 * Run on a schedule (e.g. monthly) or trigger via the in-app button:
 *   POST /api/graph/prune
