# OpenMemory

Built because working across Claude, Codex, Gemini CLI, and other AI tools means re-explaining project context from scratch every time you switch. Each AI starts fresh at every session boundary. This is the memory layer that lives outside any single AI so all of them stay in sync.

The MCP server at `icp/mcp-server/server.js` is the protocol endpoint through which any MCP-compatible AI reads and writes memory records. Configure it once, and every AI you connect to it already knows what you have been working on. The chat interface in this repository is the reference implementation demonstrating that the infrastructure works end-to-end.

Identity works differently depending on the tool. The browser chat UI holds an Ed25519 key in localStorage and signs writes directly to the ICP canister. CLI tools running in terminals (Claude Code, Gemini, Codex) share a portable identity file at `~/.config/openmemory/identity.json`, generated once with `node setup-identity.js`, and write through the MCP server rather than through a browser. A typed memory graph sits in PostgreSQL alongside the canister records, tracking relationships between memories and applying Physarum conductance dynamics that shift edge weights based on how the LLM actually uses each connection over time.

[VISION.md](./VISION.md) covers the design decisions and research questions in depth. [DEVLOG.md](./DEVLOG.md) is the running record of what was discovered building it: implementation findings, security fixes, architectural tensions, and what remains unresolved. [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) is the active research agenda: the open scientific claims, what needs to be built to test each one, and how the tracks evolve as discoveries open new questions. [SCIENCE.md](./SCIENCE.md) explains the mathematics and biology behind the graph layer in plain terms, with source citations and references to the tests that verify each formula.

## How it works

The application is a standard Laravel and Vue web app. The interesting parts are the memory layer and the graph that grows on top of it.

**Storage trigger.** Before summarizing a conversation turn, the server passes the exchange to `MemorabilityService`, which evaluates novelty, significance, durability, and connection richness against the 20 most recently created nodes. The evaluation returns one of three decisions: store a new node, update an existing node with a specific ID, or skip the turn entirely. This filter prevents ephemeral exchanges (greetings, clarifying questions, transient status updates) from creating nodes, keeping the graph focused on durable knowledge.

**Memory records.** When a turn passes the storage trigger, the server summarizes it, classifies it as public, private, or sensitive, and proceeds down the write path. In the browser chat UI, private and sensitive records require user approval before the browser signs the write with an Ed25519 key from localStorage and sends it directly to the ICP canister. The canister records `msg.caller` as the owner of that record. CLI tools writing through the MCP server POST to the Laravel `/mcp/store` endpoint in mock mode, which handles graph extraction and node storage server-side without a browser session.

**The memory graph.** After every confirmed memory write, a second LLM call extracts a node type (memory, person, project, document, task, event, or concept), a label, semantic tags, named people, and named projects from the memory content. This data creates a typed graph node in PostgreSQL and auto-wires edges to related existing nodes: tag overlap produces `same_topic_as` edges; named people produce `about_person` edges to person anchor nodes; named projects produce `part_of` edges to project anchor nodes.

**Physarum dynamics.** Edge weights are not static. When the LLM retrieves a set of memory nodes to build a response, all edges between those co-accessed nodes receive a conductance increment of ALPHA = 0.10, clamped to 1.0. A daily scheduled command applies a decay factor of RHO = 0.97 to all edges, floored at 0.05. Edges that are traversed together regularly accumulate weight; edges between memories that the agent never retrieves together decay toward the floor. This implements the discrete form of the Tero et al. (2010) slime mold conductance model: paths the organism uses frequently develop higher conductance, and paths that carry no flux thin out.

**LLM recall.** Only public memories are loaded into the LLM context. Private and sensitive records are gated by `msg.caller` on the canister: anonymous callers (the server adapter, the MCP server, and external HTTP clients) receive only public records.

**Active node IDs.** The `/chat/send` response includes an `active_node_ids` field listing the graph nodes loaded into context that turn. The Three.js mission control surface at `/3d` reads this field to highlight which nodes were active on the most recent turn.

**Graph partition simulation.** Multiple named graph partitions can be created under the same owner at `/agents`. Each partition holds its own subgraph seeded from the owner's public nodes. When two partitions both access nodes derived from the same memory content, a shared edge accumulates weight at `SHARED_ALPHA * trust_score`. The trust score is adjustable per partition, making each one's contribution to the collective graph proportional to its assigned reputation. These partitions model different agent roles or conversation contexts sharing a common memory substrate; actual external AI agents connect via the MCP server rather than through this simulation panel.

**Cluster detection.** Weighted label propagation (Raghavan et al. 2007) partitions the personal or collective graph into communities on demand. Cluster membership and mean internal weight are written to `graph_snapshots` every 15 minutes and feed the temporal axis scrubber in the Three.js surface.

**Consolidation.** A weekly scheduled command runs `ConsolidationService`, which inspects every cluster with a mean internal edge weight above 0.30 and at least five unconsolidated nodes. Qualifying clusters are compressed: the LLM produces a one-sentence summary of the cluster's common theme, a new `concept` node is created from that summary, and all absorbed episodic nodes are stamped with a `consolidated_at` timestamp and excluded from future retrieval and consolidation passes. The concept node is wired to the absorbed nodes via `supersedes` edges, and any edges from outside the cluster that formerly targeted absorbed nodes are re-wired to the concept node. This mirrors hippocampal-to-cortical transfer: many episodic traces consolidate into a single navigable semantic node. The consolidation trigger is also exposed as `POST /api/graph/consolidate` for in-app use.

**Pruning.** A monthly scheduled command runs `PruneMemoryNodes`, which deletes nodes that meet two conditions simultaneously: all of their edges have decayed to floor weight (0.06 or below), and the node has not been accessed in the past 90 days. Nodes with no edges at all that are older than 90 days are also deleted. Pruning removes edges first, then nodes, to avoid foreign-key violations. The pruning trigger is also exposed as `POST /api/graph/prune` for in-app use.

## Memory types

The three memory tiers are the core of the trust model:

| Type | LLM context | Owner panel | Requires approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| public | Yes | Yes | No |
| private | No | Yes | Yes |
| sensitive | No | Yes | Yes |

Public memories are the only records the LLM can recall. Private and sensitive records are owner-gated at the canister level, not just by application code. The graph layer inherits the sensitivity of the source memory record: anchor nodes created for a private memory are themselves private, so they do not appear in the public graph.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Laravel 12, PHP 8.3 |
| Frontend | Vue 3, Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Docker) or SQLite (local development) |
| LLM | OpenRouter, model configurable via `OPENROUTER_MODEL` |
| Memory records | ICP canister (Motoko), browser-signed writes (chat UI), MCP server writes (CLI tools), Node.js adapter for server reads |
| Memory graph | PostgreSQL tables (`memory_nodes`, `memory_edges`), Physarum dynamics, D3 force-directed explorer at `/graph` |
| Graph partition layer | PostgreSQL tables (`agents`, `shared_memory_edges`, `graph_snapshots`), collective Physarum dynamics across named partitions, Three.js mission control surface at `/3d` |

---

## Quickstart without Docker

```bash
cd app
cp .env.example .env
# Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY in .env (get a key at https://openrouter.ai/keys)
php artisan key:generate
composer install
npm install
php artisan migrate
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

Open http://localhost:8000. Memory runs in mock mode by default, so no canister or adapter is needed to get started.

---

## Quickstart with Docker and PostgreSQL

```bash
cp app/.env.example app/.env
# Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY in app/.env

docker compose up -d
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

Open http://localhost:8080.

---

## Mock mode

Setting `ICP_MOCK_MODE=true` (the default) replaces the ICP canister with Laravel's file cache. This is the right way to run the application locally or in CI when you don't have a running dfx replica or deployed canister. The LLM still calls OpenRouter for chat responses, but no ICP tooling is required.

Private and sensitive memories show the same approval dialogs in mock mode that they do in live mode. The graph layer runs identically in both modes because it operates entirely within PostgreSQL.

---

## Swapping models

Change `OPENROUTER_MODEL` in `.env` and restart the server. The full model list is at https://openrouter.ai/models.

```env
OPENROUTER_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5    # default
OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-flash         # faster, lower cost
OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-flash:free    # free tier, rate-limited
OPENROUTER_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free   # free tier, rate-limited
```

The memory layer and graph layer store identical records regardless of which model is in use.

---

## The memory graph explorer

The graph explorer is at `/graph`. It renders the full memory graph as a D3 force-directed visualization with a radial gradient background and an SVG glow filter applied to every node so that each node type glows in its assigned color. Three views are available: the graph (nodes and weighted edges in 2D space), a timeline (nodes in chronological order), and a list (filterable grid).

The left panel controls node type filters, sensitivity filters, and content search, with live counts for nodes, edges, and clusters. The right panel shows node detail on click: type, sensitivity, label, content, tags, and connected nodes with relationship labels. Clicking "Expand neighborhood" fetches the two-hop neighborhood from the server and merges it into the current view.

Node radius scales with degree count. Edge width and edge color both reflect the current Physarum weight and source node type: thick, brightly tinted edges are Hebbian paths the agent has traversed frequently; thin edges are dormant connections decaying toward the floor. Running the Physarum simulation from the bottom control bar animates edge width transitions and flashes a ring on each active node.

The Three.js mission control surface is at `/3d`. It renders the multi-agent graph in three-dimensional space against a starfield of 2800 background stars. Every node has a glow aura scaled to match its degree: hub nodes with many connections appear as large bright orbs; leaf nodes appear small. Node radius scales continuously with degree count so the scale-free topology is visible at a glance without reading a number. Agent partitions occupy distinct spatial regions arranged in a ring. Shared nodes float at partition boundaries in violet.

When the simulation runs, traversal particles travel along edge geometry from active nodes toward their neighbors. Each particle eases in and out along the edge path so the motion reads as a propagating signal rather than a linear slide. High-weight edges emit a return particle as well, giving a bidirectional signal appearance on heavily reinforced paths. Each active node simultaneously emits an expanding wireframe pulse ring that grows from radius 1 to radius 12 and fades to transparent over one second. The combined effect makes the Physarum traversal visible as live signal propagation rather than as a flashing indicator. A temporal axis scrubber replays cluster snapshots from the past 24 hours. An intent alignment panel shows pairwise Jaccard similarity of agent active content sets. The camera performs a slow auto-orbit that pauses while the simulation is running.

The multi-agent simulation is at `/agents`. Create agents, adjust trust scores with a color-coded trust bar that fills green for high-trust agents and red for low-trust ones, seed each agent's partition from the owner's public nodes, and run per-agent or collective simulation ticks to observe how shared edge weights evolve. Nodes that appear in more than one agent's active retrieval set are highlighted with a violet border and a full-width weight bar. The "Seed demo day" button in the left sidebar runs `simulate:day` from the browser without requiring terminal access, with an option to wipe existing data first.

---

## Seeding demo data

The `simulate:day` command generates a realistic 8-hour workday of memory activity without requiring an API key or a live ICP canister. It creates memory nodes across four topic clusters (technical decisions, project planning, research concepts, and personal workflow), wires edges, runs six Physarum reinforcement turns, creates three agents with different trust scores, and takes a graph snapshot. All five surfaces have data to render after it completes.

```bash
php artisan simulate:day                 # 40 memories (default)
php artisan simulate:day --fresh         # wipe existing demo data first
php artisan simulate:day --memories=60   # denser graph
```

After the command completes, navigate to `/graph` to see the memory graph, `/agents` to see Nexus, Beacon, and Ghost, and `/3d` for the mission control surface.

---

## Scheduled maintenance commands

**Edge weight decay** runs daily and applies the Physarum decay factor to all edges:

```bash
php artisan memory:decay
```

The decay constant RHO = 0.97 means edges lose approximately 3% of their weight per day when not reinforced. An edge at weight 0.5 that receives no reinforcement reaches the floor (0.05) after approximately 100 days.

**Cluster consolidation** runs weekly and compresses high-density episodic clusters into semantic concept nodes:

```bash
php artisan memory:consolidate           # all users
php artisan memory:consolidate --user=X  # specific user
```

**Node pruning** runs monthly and hard-deletes dormant nodes whose edges have all decayed to floor weight:

```bash
php artisan memory:prune                 # all users
php artisan memory:prune --user=X        # specific user
php artisan memory:prune --dry-run       # report without deleting
php artisan memory:prune --days=60       # shorter idle threshold
```

All three commands are scheduled automatically via `routes/console.php`. Both consolidation and pruning are also triggerable from the graph explorer UI at `/graph` without terminal access.

## Connecting a real ICP canister

```bash
# Install dfx
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

# Start a local replica and deploy the canister
cd icp
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
dfx canister id memory   # note this ID for the next steps

# Start the Node adapter in a separate terminal
cd icp/adapter
npm install
ICP_MOCK=false ICP_CANISTER_ID=<canister-id> node server.js

# Update app/.env
ICP_MOCK_MODE=false
ICP_CANISTER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3100
ICP_CANISTER_ID=<canister-id>
ICP_BROWSER_HOST=http://localhost:4943    # use https://ic0.app for mainnet
```

---

## Connecting CLI tools via MCP

Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, and any other MCP-compatible tool can read and write memories through the MCP server. All tools share a single portable Ed25519 identity file, so writes from any tool accumulate under the same principal and appear in the same graph.

```bash
# 1. Install the MCP server dependencies
cd icp/mcp-server
npm install

# 2. Generate the shared identity file (run once)
node setup-identity.js
# Prints your principal and the path of the created file.
# Back the file up. Losing it means losing the ability to reclaim canister-signed records.

# 3. Generate a shared secret for the Laravel endpoint
openssl rand -hex 32
# Add this value to app/.env as MCP_API_KEY=<value>

# 4. Add the MCP server to your tool config
# Example for Claude Code (~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json):
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openMemory": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/icp/mcp-server/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "OMA_MOCK_URL": "http://localhost:8080",
        "OMA_API_KEY": "<value from step 3>",
        "OMA_USER_ID": "<any stable string identifying you>",
        "WRITE_SCOPE": "public,private"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `WRITE_SCOPE` env var controls which sensitivity levels the MCP server will accept. The default is `public` only. Set it to `public,private` to allow private writes. Sensitive writes are always blocked at the MCP layer regardless of scope. Set `WRITE_SCOPE=none` to make the server read-only.

In mock mode (`ICP_MOCK_MODE=true`), the MCP server POSTs to `OMA_MOCK_URL/mcp/store` and memory nodes are created in the local PostgreSQL graph. In live ICP mode (no `OMA_MOCK_URL` set), the server signs canister calls directly with the loaded identity.

---

## Running tests

```bash
cd app
php artisan test
```

The test suite runs against SQLite in-memory and mock mode throughout. No API key or canister is required. Coverage includes the storage trigger (MemorabilityService decisions, hallucinated node ID rejection, consolidated node exclusion), graph reinforcement, edge decay, neighborhood traversal, cluster detection determinism, graph snapshot storage and pruning, agent alignment Jaccard calculation, the memory approval flow, the `active_node_ids` response field, consolidation pipeline (concept node creation, supersedes edges, sensitivity inheritance, re-consolidation prevention), node pruning (floor-weight detection, idle window, edge cascade delete, user scoping, dry-run), the MCP store endpoint (API key auth, graph node creation), and the ThreeD page load with agent scoping.
