# OpenMemoryAgent

Portable, sovereign, AI-agnostic long-term memory. You own it. You carry it. Every AI you work with plugs into the same memory graph via MCP. When the conversation ends, what you learned goes back in. The next AI you open already knows who you are.

The user's browser holds an Ed25519 signing key; writes to the ICP canister are authenticated with that key so no server can write memory records under a user's identity. A typed memory graph sits in PostgreSQL alongside the canister records, tracking relationships between memories and applying Physarum conductance dynamics that shift edge weights based on how the agent actually uses each connection over time. The MCP server at `icp/mcp-server/server.js` is the protocol endpoint through which any MCP-compatible AI gains access to the memory graph. The chat interface in this repository is the reference implementation showing that the infrastructure works.

[VISION.md](./VISION.md) covers the design decisions and research questions in depth. [DEVLOG.md](./DEVLOG.md) is the running record of what was discovered building it: implementation findings, security fixes, architectural tensions, and what remains unresolved. [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) is the active research agenda: the open scientific claims, what needs to be built to test each one, and how the tracks evolve as discoveries open new questions. [SCIENCE.md](./SCIENCE.md) explains the mathematics and biology behind the graph layer in plain terms, with source citations and references to the tests that verify each formula.

## How it works

The application is a standard Laravel and Vue web app. The interesting parts are the memory layer and the graph that grows on top of it.

**Memory records.** When a conversation produces something worth remembering, the server summarizes it, classifies it as public, private, or sensitive, and returns it to the browser. If the user approves (required for private and sensitive records), the browser signs the write with an Ed25519 key from localStorage and sends it to the ICP canister directly. The canister records `msg.caller` as the owner of that record. The server is not in that write path and cannot forge a write under the user's principal.

**The memory graph.** After every confirmed memory write, a second LLM call extracts a node type (memory, person, project, document, task, event, or concept), a label, semantic tags, named people, and named projects from the memory content. This data creates a typed graph node in PostgreSQL and auto-wires edges to related existing nodes: tag overlap produces `same_topic_as` edges; named people produce `about_person` edges to person anchor nodes; named projects produce `part_of` edges to project anchor nodes.

**Physarum dynamics.** Edge weights are not static. When the LLM retrieves a set of memory nodes to build a response, all edges between those co-accessed nodes receive a conductance increment of ALPHA = 0.10, clamped to 1.0. A daily scheduled command applies a decay factor of RHO = 0.97 to all edges, floored at 0.05. Edges that are traversed together regularly accumulate weight; edges between memories that the agent never retrieves together decay toward the floor. This implements the discrete form of the Tero et al. (2010) slime mold conductance model: paths the organism uses frequently develop higher conductance, and paths that carry no flux thin out.

**LLM recall.** Only public memories are loaded into the LLM context. Private and sensitive records are gated by `msg.caller` on the canister: anonymous callers (the server adapter, the MCP server, and external HTTP clients) receive only public records.

**Active node IDs.** The `/chat/send` response includes an `active_node_ids` field listing the graph nodes loaded into context that turn. The Three.js mission control surface at `/3d` reads this field to highlight which nodes were active on the most recent turn.

**Multi-agent simulation.** Multiple agents can be created under the same owner at `/agents`. Each agent holds its own graph partition. When two agents both access nodes derived from the same memory content, a shared edge accumulates weight at `SHARED_ALPHA * trust_score`. The trust score is adjustable per agent, making each agent's contribution to the collective graph proportional to its established reputation.

**Cluster detection.** Weighted label propagation (Raghavan et al. 2007) partitions the personal or collective graph into communities on demand. Cluster membership and mean internal weight are written to `graph_snapshots` every 15 minutes and feed the temporal axis scrubber in the Three.js surface.

## Memory types

The three memory tiers are the core of the trust model:

| Type | LLM context | Owner panel | Requires approval |
|---|---|---|---|
| public | Yes | Yes | No |
| private | No | Yes | Yes |
| sensitive | No | Yes | Yes |

Public memories are the only records the LLM can recall. Private and sensitive records are owner-gated at the canister level, not just by application code. The graph layer inherits the sensitivity of the source memory record: anchor nodes created for a private memory are themselves private, so they do not appear in the public graph.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Laravel 12, PHP 8.3 |
| Frontend | Vue 3, Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Docker) or SQLite (local development) |
| LLM | OpenRouter, model configurable via `OPENROUTER_MODEL` |
| Memory records | ICP canister (Motoko), browser-signed writes, Node.js adapter for server reads |
| Memory graph | PostgreSQL tables (`memory_nodes`, `memory_edges`), Physarum dynamics, D3 force-directed explorer at `/graph` |
| Multi-agent graph | PostgreSQL tables (`agents`, `shared_memory_edges`, `graph_snapshots`), collective Physarum dynamics, Three.js mission control surface at `/3d` |

## Quickstart without Docker

```bash
cd app
cp .env.example .env
# Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY in .env (get a key at https://openrouter.ai/keys)
php artisan key:generate
composer install
npm install
php artisan migrate
npm run build
php artisan serve
```

Open http://localhost:8000. Memory runs in mock mode by default, so no canister or adapter is needed to get started.

---

## Quickstart with Docker and PostgreSQL

```bash
cp app/.env.example app/.env
# Set OPENROUTER_API_KEY in app/.env

docker compose up -d
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate
docker compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

Open http://localhost:8080.

---

## Mock mode

Setting `ICP_MOCK_MODE=true` (the default) replaces the ICP canister with Laravel's file cache. This is the right way to run the application locally or in CI when you don't have a running dfx replica or deployed canister. The LLM still calls OpenRouter for chat responses, but no ICP tooling is required.

Private and sensitive memories show the same approval dialogs in mock mode that they do in live mode. The graph layer runs identically in both modes because it operates entirely within PostgreSQL.

---

## Swapping models

Change `OPENROUTER_MODEL` in `.env` and restart the server. The full model list is at https://openrouter.ai/models.

```env
OPENROUTER_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5    # default
OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-flash         # faster, lower cost
OPENROUTER_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-flash:free    # free tier, rate-limited
OPENROUTER_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free   # free tier, rate-limited
```

The memory layer and graph layer store identical records regardless of which model is in use.

---

## The memory graph explorer

The graph explorer is available at `/graph`. It shows the full memory graph for the current user as a D3 force-directed visualization. Three views are available: the graph (nodes and edges in 2D space), a timeline (nodes in chronological order), and a list (filterable grid).

The left panel provides controls for filtering by node type, filtering by sensitivity, and searching across labels and content, with live counts of nodes, edges, and clusters. Right panel shows node details on click: type, sensitivity, label, content, tags, and connected nodes with their relationship labels. Clicking "Expand neighborhood" fetches the node's two-hop neighborhood from the server and merges it into the current view.

Node radius scales with degree count. Edge width reflects the current Physarum weight: thick edges are Hebbian paths the agent has traversed frequently; thin edges are dormant connections that have decayed toward the floor.

The Three.js mission control surface is available at `/3d`. It renders the multi-agent graph at the cluster level. Agent partitions occupy distinct spatial regions. Shared nodes, those whose content appears in more than one agent's partition, float at partition boundaries colored violet. A temporal axis scrubber loads cluster snapshots from the past 24 hours. An intent alignment panel shows pairwise Jaccard similarity of agent active content sets.

The multi-agent simulation is available at `/agents`. Create agents, adjust trust scores, seed each agent's partition from the owner's public nodes, and run per-agent or collective simulation ticks to observe how shared edge weights evolve.

---

## Seeding demo data

The `simulate:day` command generates a realistic 8-hour workday of memory activity without requiring an API key or a live ICP canister. It creates memory nodes across four topic clusters (technical decisions, project planning, research concepts, and personal workflow), wires edges, runs six Physarum reinforcement turns, creates three agents with different trust scores, and takes a graph snapshot. All five surfaces have data to render after it completes.

```bash
php artisan simulate:day                 # 40 memories (default)
php artisan simulate:day --fresh         # wipe existing demo data first
php artisan simulate:day --memories=60   # denser graph
```

After the command completes, navigate to `/graph` to see the memory graph, `/agents` to see Nexus, Beacon, and Ghost, and `/3d` for the mission control surface.

---

## Edge weight decay

A daily Artisan command applies the Physarum decay factor to all edges in the graph:

```bash
php artisan memory:decay
```

This is scheduled to run automatically via `routes/console.php`. The decay constant RHO = 0.97 means edges lose approximately 3% of their weight per day when not reinforced. An edge at weight 0.5 that receives no reinforcement reaches the floor (0.05) after approximately 100 days.

---

## Connecting a real ICP canister

```bash
# Install dfx
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

# Start a local replica and deploy the canister
cd icp
dfx start --background
dfx deploy
dfx canister id memory   # note this ID for the next steps

# Start the Node adapter in a separate terminal
cd icp/adapter
npm install
ICP_MOCK=false ICP_CANISTER_ID=<canister-id> node server.js

# Update app/.env
ICP_MOCK_MODE=false
ICP_CANISTER_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3100
ICP_CANISTER_ID=<canister-id>
ICP_BROWSER_HOST=http://localhost:4943    # use https://ic0.app for mainnet
```

---

## Running tests

```bash
cd app
php artisan test
```

The test suite runs against SQLite in-memory and mock mode throughout. No API key or canister is required. Coverage includes graph reinforcement, edge decay, neighborhood traversal, cluster detection determinism, graph snapshot storage and pruning, agent alignment Jaccard calculation, the memory approval flow, the `active_node_ids` response field, and the ThreeD page load with agent scoping.
